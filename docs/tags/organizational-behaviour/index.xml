      <description>Problem Statement #  In the wake of unexpected leadership changes at AnotherInc Inc., Ethan, a previously successful vice president, faces significant challenges stemming from the companyâ€™s altered dynamics alongside his diminished recognition and estrangement from relevant work. These challenges have been underscored by a shift in power structures and a noticeable change in professional attitudes towards Ethan by the new leaders, Marcus and Daveed. The situation has further escalated due to what he perceives as unfair evaluations, further exacerbating his marginalisation within the organisation.</description>
