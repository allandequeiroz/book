      <description>Ol√°!
Inspired by the posts from Viktor Adam&amp;rsquo;s blog, when I have some spare time I have been playing with Docker and some open source tools to build this blog.
So far I have my two little devices a Raspberry Pi and a Rock64 hosting this blog, yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right, you&amp;rsquo;re reading this straight from a Ghost blog behind an NGinx hosted at my home, be nice and say hi!</description>

      <description>Homemade Kubernetes Cluster #  In my previous post, I wrote about how to set up a scalable Jenkins using Kubernetes at home on top of home devices, in my case, 3 Raspberries, 2 Rock64 and a NUC. Since it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a 5 minutes task I&amp;rsquo;ll describe here the steps I went through to get it working.
Pre-checks #  Before installing Kubernetes you better check which Docker version is supported by the Kubernetes version you intend to install, a few days ago I upgraded my Kubernetes cluster from version 12 to 15 so, version 15 is what I&amp;rsquo;ll be used as a reference here.</description>

      <description>How to Setup Scalable Jenkins on Top of a Kubernetes Cluster (At Home). #   Before we start, I&amp;rsquo;ll make some intro about the scenario and reasons for my choices, if you prefer, skip this part, the meat of the article starts at the Docker section.
 A few days ago I decided to start a new side project, a tool that will take care of a bunch of things I need; I pay for different ones, and yet they don&amp;rsquo;t cover everything I need.</description>

      <description>TLDR; A walk through an EC2 instance setup, dynamically attaching volumes snapshots and configuring Cloudflare DNS entries pointing to the new instance using Terraform and Docker (Ghost, Traefik).
Source code: https://github.com/allandequeiroz/blog/tree/extract_variables
Basic infrastructure configuration using Terraform, Docker (Ghost, Traefik) and Cloudflare. #  For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted this blog, at home, using Docker and Kubernetes across a few Raspberries (I use it as an excuse to do play around). It turns out that I&amp;rsquo;m moving to a new place, so I have a new excuse to play with something else.</description>
